# OJA Delivery Plan – Actionable Task Breakdown

This backlog converts the production blueprint into execution-ready tasks. Each task includes the concrete outcomes, dependencies, and validation steps needed to ship the feature without regressions.

## Execution Order

All workstreams move strictly in sequence. Stage 0 is a hard gate before any feature code ships. Stage A begins only after the Stage 0 exit criteria are signed off. Subsequent stages (B → E) and cross-cutting tracks start once Stage A is live in staging with the ₦100 payment validation completed.

For each numbered task below, execute the subtasks top-to-bottom; do not parallelise across stages unless their prerequisites explicitly allow it.
