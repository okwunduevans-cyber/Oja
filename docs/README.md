# OJA Documentation Index

This directory groups the planning and onboarding guides that previously lived at the repository root so merges with `main` stay clean.

- [`plan-2.md`](plan-2.md) – hard constraints, IA, and platform blueprint captured in Plan 2.
- [`delivery-plan.md`](delivery-plan.md) – actionable Stage 0–E backlog with outcomes, dependencies, and validation gates.
- [`about-oja.md`](about-oja.md) – market context, differentiators, and technology blueprint refresh.
- [`setup-guide.md`](setup-guide.md) – Android Studio project bootstrap instructions and file listings.

All docs keep their original Markdown content; only the paths changed.
